I'd like to run automated tests with reCAPTCHA v2. What should I do?

    With the following test keys, you will always get No CAPTCHA and all verification requests will pass.

        Site key: 6LeIxAcTAAAAAJcZVRqyHh71UMIEGNQ_MXjiZKhI
        Secret key: 6LeIxAcTAAAAAGG-vFI1TnRWxMZNFuojJ4WifJWe

    The reCAPTCHA widget will show a warning message to claim that it's only for testing purpose. Please do not use these keys for your production traffic.
